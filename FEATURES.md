echo "# 🔐 Silencium – Feature Roadmap

## ✅ Completed
- End-to-end encrypted messaging (libsodium.js)
- System messages for room creation/join/leave
- Chatroom reset on user exit
- Hacker-style dark UI
- Mobile responsive design

## 🛠️ In Progress
- [ ] Auto self-destruct after 5 mins inactivity
- [ ] One-view image sharing (no download/screenshot)
- [ ] Defensive hardening against known attacks
- [ ] Partial screenshot prevention measures (experimental)

## 🧠 Planned Security Defenses
- XSS protection
- Replay attack defense
- Key fingerprint comparison
- Rate limiting and flood control

## 📌 Notes
- Screenshot prevention is limited on web platforms. We'll implement deterrents, not guarantees.
- No images are stored. Every asset is ephemeral and encrypted.
